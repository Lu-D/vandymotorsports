 which is smaller than the optimal domain size of 120 elements for the   
 given number of CPU domains (4).  Therefore, no contact pairs are       
 being split by the CNCH,DMP logic.

 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 in-core memory mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory   
 in order to avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most  
 often results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended   
 if enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver   
 data.
